  <h2>The philosophy of Jellyfish</h2>
  <p>
    I was reading about jellyfish yesterday and I learned that jellyfish have what is called a decentralized nervous system (which means that they don't have a brain). I wonder what a jellyfish would think of that. You might think, well, a jellyfish wouldn't think anything about it, because a jellyfish doesn't have a brain to think with, but I think that's jumping to a really dramatic conclusion: jellyfish do not think in the way that you think of when you hear someone say (or write) the word think, but they do have sensory organs (though almost all their actions are reflexive) which means they do have experiences which means that it is something to be a jellyfish (even if it is not much). A jellyfish could write a book on jellyfish philosophy and it would be something, though I suspect it would be very different from human philosophy: we exist and twitch when something touches us and automatically digest literally anything (food or otherwise) that comes into our stomach and occasionally we drop our eggs and sperm in the ocean to reproduce. And the funny thing is that humans would, in response, probably make a list of reasons why a jellyfish can't possibly have a philosophy, and the reason at the top of the list would probably be LACK OF CENTRALIZED NERVOUS SYSTEM, as if that were a requirement for examining one's existence. I found an abandoned crate of Top Ramen (beef flavor) next to the dumpster by my apartment complex last week and had a reflexive reaction and I'm now halfway through writing a philosophy on finding and taking inside and eating my way through an abandoned crate of Top Ramen that I found next to the dumpster by my apartment complex. The treatise has a lot to do with why it happened, but I occasionally dip into the hows (there is an eight-page section detailing the argument I had with my mother [about taking out the garbage, uncoincidentally] immediately before the event).
